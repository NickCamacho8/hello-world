My first repository

Hello World,

My name is Nick Camacho and I currently live in San Diego with my wife and four kids.  I presently work for the City of San Diego as a Project Officer in the Engineering & Capital Projects Department.  My interests include hanging out with my family, exploring hidden San Diego, watching soccer, and trying new craft breweries.

Cheers!
